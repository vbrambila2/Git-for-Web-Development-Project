# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Task 1: Set up Project
You will need to follow the BloomTech Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [ X] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [ X] Clone this repo
- [ X] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
- [X ] Complete your set up tasks ans answer the questions in the `mac.md` or `pc.md` file, depending on which operating system you are using. Please not that if you are on a linux machine, you should be completing the `mac.md` file.
- [ X] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ X] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
- [ X] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).


## Task 2: MVP

Welcome to day 1 at BloomTech, today we are going to spend time setting up your computer and learning the tools that you will be using to complete this program. Just like day 1 at a job, you will need to get your environment set up to build and run your code. Complete the set up tasks and then get started on the research questions. If you are using a windows machine, please complete the `pc.md` file, if you are using mac or linux please complete `mac.md`.
